## Description
Module 2 asks us to creating a portfolio website from scratch, using a responsive layout with HTML and CSS. 

## Motivation
This project was created to use advanced CSS skills alongside HTML. The objective being to build a website from scratch. 

## Build status
* The starter code has been built from scratch by Adela Kobic (Coding Student). 
* Code will need to be refactored at a later date to check for bugs.

## Code style
* Standard HTML and CSS has been used for this project. 
The language for the website is written in US English. (USA English)

## Acceptance Criteria
* The developers name, recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work and how to contact them should be displayed on the website.
* When clicking on the links in the navigation bar the User Interface scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When clicking on the section about the develoers work the UI scrolls to a section with titles images of the developers applications. 
* The first application should be larger in size than the others displayed.
* When you click on the images of the applications you are taken to that deployed application.
* When you resize the page or view the site on various screens a responsive layout adapts to the viewport. 

## Assets
This finished website should resemble the layout as shown in this image (images and titles may differ.)

## Problems encountered 
* geting the navigation bar to sit horizontally below the header 'Flea Box Folio'
* creating buttns that link to each section of the page
* ensuring the UI buttons scroll down to the relevant section of the page 
* geting the aside bar to sit alongside the body of the text and images even after using 'aside' tags  - TEMPORARILY FIXED 8 July 2022 by placing the aside tags in beween each section but they do not sit comfortably. 
* making the images fit the boxes after reducing their size, some are still too big for the box
