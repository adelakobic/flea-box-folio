# flea-box-folio

## Description 📜
Module 2 asks us to create a portfolio website from scratch, using a responsive layout with HTML and CSS using flex-box. 

## Motivation 💪🏻
This project was created to use advanced CSS skills alongside HTML. The objective was to build a portfolio website from scratch. The folio should scroll to each section when required after clicking the navigation links. 

## Build status 🏗
* The starter code has been built from scratch by Adela Kobic (Coding Student). 
* Code will need to be refactored at a later date to check for bugs, further adjustments and adding in proper links to the dummy ones.

## Code style 🔐
* Standard HTML and CSS has been used for this project. 
The language for the website is written in US English. (USA English)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
* The developers name, recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work and how to contact them should be displayed on the website.
* When clicking on the links in the navigation bar the User Interface scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When clicking on the section about the develoers work the UI scrolls to a section with titles images of the developers applications.
* The first application should be larger in size than the others displayed.
* When you click on the images of the applications you are taken to that deployed application.
* When you resize the page or view the site on various screens a responsive layout adapts to the viewport. 

## Assets 📷
This finished website should resemble the layout as shown in this image (images and titles may differ.)

## Problems encountered 🤯
* geting the navigation bar to sit horizontally below the header 'Flea Box Folio'
* creating buttons that link to each section of the page - PARTLY FIXED - links created 9 July 2022, but the scrolling down hasnt worked for all of the links.
* ensuring the UI buttons scroll down to the relevant section of the page - FIXED 9 July 2022, but the Work and Contact 'scroll down' button doesn't work as it should. 
* geting the aside bar to sit alongside the body of the text and images even after using 'aside' tags  - TEMPORARILY FIXED 8 July 2022 by placing the aside tags in beween each section but they do not sit comfortably. 
* making the first image larger than all the others - issues with the grid/ flex-box - so the command (transform: scale 1,2) did not work successfully.

## Changes made to the code 𝌡
* the initial code has been created by Adela Kobic
* changes to the CSS and HTML have been made to ensure 'aside' sits comfortably, and that the scroll links to sections are in place.
